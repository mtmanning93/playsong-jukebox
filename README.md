## Functions

### Add Song

The add song function enables the user to add a song to their library through the inputs of artist name, song title, genre, year and link.

- Artist Name, Song Title
    - These inputs validates whether the user input is no longer than 40 characters long and if so asks the user to shorten the input.

- Genre
    - When the user enters a genre which is not already in the library it is extracted from the library and added to the 'genre-list', available to the user when using the [Search JukeboX](#search-jukebox) function.

- Year
    - A user must insert a year when adding a new song this enables easier searching later on and the ability to list songs from the same year. It is validated to ensure the input is an integer, 4 digits long and within the dates of 1900 to current year. Current year is used from the 'datetime' import instead of a set year to ensure app usability in the future.

- Link
    - The link is the final input. In order to add a link the app provides a link to the youtube search. Generated by the concatenating the artist name and song title input. Once the user has found the desired video link they can copy and paste it into the input field. Here it is checked whether it is a url or not via the validators import.

When the add song process is finished th app provides a clear message that the song has been added to the library and restarts the app. Ensuring the app is up to date with new song and the user is able to immediately search for the same song.
